- `image_description` (string) - The description of the packer image.

- `image_type` (string) - The type of the packer image. Available values include:
  *system*, *data-disk*, *full-ecs*.

- `image_tags` (map[string]string) - The tags of the packer image in key/value format.

- `image_members` ([]string) - List of members to add to the image after creation. An image member is
  usually a project (also called the "tenant") with whom the image is
  shared.

- `image_auto_accept_members` (bool) - **Deprecated**. When true, perform the image accept so the members can see the image in their
  project. This requires a user with priveleges both in the build project and
  in the members provided. Defaults to false.

- `wait_image_ready_timeout` (string) - Timeout of creating the image. The timeout string is a possibly signed sequence of
  decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "40m", "1.5h" or "2h30m".
  The default timeout is "30m" which means 30 minutes.
