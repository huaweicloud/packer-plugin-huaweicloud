- `image_description` (string) - Specifies the image description.

- `image_members` ([]string) - List of members to add to the image after creation. An image member is
  usually a project (also called the "tenant") with whom the image is
  shared.

- `image_auto_accept_members` (bool) - **Deprecated**. When true, perform the image accept so the members can see the image in their
  project. This requires a user with priveleges both in the build project and
  in the members provided. Defaults to false.

- `image_tags` (map[string]string) - The tags of the image in key/pair format.
